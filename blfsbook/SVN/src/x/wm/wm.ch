    <para>Window Managers and Desktop Environments are the primary user
    interfaces into the <application>X</application> Window System. A window
    manager is a program that controls the appearance of windows and provides
    the means by which the user can interact with them. A Desktop Environment
    provides a more complete interface to the operating system, and provides a
    range of integrated utilities and applications.</para>

    <para>Choosing a Window Manager or Desktop Environment is highly
    subjective. The choice depends on the look and feel of the packages, the
    resources (RAM, disk space) required, and the utilities included.
    One web site that provides a very good summary of what is available,
    screenshots, and their respective features is
    <ulink url="http://www.plig.org/xwinman/">Window Managers for
    X</ulink>.</para>
