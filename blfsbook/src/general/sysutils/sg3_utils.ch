@x
      The <application>sg3_utils</application> package contains low level
      utilities for devices that use a SCSI command set. Apart from SCSI parallel
      interface (SPI) devices, the SCSI command set is used by ATAPI devices
      (CD/DVDs and tapes), USB mass storage devices, Fibre Channel disks, IEEE
      1394 storage devices (that use the "SBP" protocol), SAS, iSCSI and FCoE
      devices (amongst others).
