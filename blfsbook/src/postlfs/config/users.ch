  <para>Throughout BLFS, many packages install programs that
  run as daemons or in some way should have a user or group name
  assigned.  Generally these names are used to map a user ID (uid) or group
  ID (gid) for system use.  Generally the specific uid or gid numbers used
  by these applications are not significant.  The exception of course, is
  that <systemitem class='username'>root</systemitem> has a uid and gid of 0
  (zero) that is indeed special.  The uid values are stored in
  <filename>/etc/passwd</filename> and the gid values
  are found in <filename>/etc/group</filename>.</para>

  <para>Customarily, Unix systems classify users and groups into two
  categories: system users and regular users.  The system users and groups are
  given low numbers and regular users and groups have numeric values greater
  than all the system values.  The cutoff for these numbers is found in two
  parameters in the <filename>/etc/login.defs</filename> configuration file.
  The default UID_MIN value is 1000 and the default GID_MIN value is 1000.  If a
  specific uid or gid value is not specified when creating a user with
  <command>useradd</command> or a group with <command>groupadd</command> the values
  assigned will always be above these cutoff values.</para>

  <para>Below is a table of suggested uid/gid values used in BLFS beyond those
  defined in a base LFS installation.  These can be changed as desired, but
  provide a suggested set of consistent values.</para>

  <para>One value that is missing is 65534.  This value is customarily assigned
  to the user <systemitem class="username">nobody</systemitem> and group
  <systemitem class="groupname">nogroup</systemitem> and is unnecessary.
