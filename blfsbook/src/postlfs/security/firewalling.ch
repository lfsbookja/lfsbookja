    <para>In a perfect world, every daemon or service on every machine
    is perfectly configured and immune to flaws such as buffer overflows
    or other problems regarding its security. Furthermore, you trust

    to have a firewall.</para>

<para>
理想の話をすれば、コンピュータ上のデーモンプログラムやサービスは、設定が完璧に行われ、バッファオーバーフローなどのセキュリティに関する危険にさらされないようになっているべきものです。

こういう状況であればファイアウォールなど一切必要ないということになります。

    <para>In the real world however, daemons may be misconfigured and
    exploits against essential services are freely available. You may
    wish to choose which services are accessible by certain machines or
    you may wish to limit which machines or applications are allowed
    external access. Alternatively, you may simply not trust some of
    your applications or users. You are probably connected to the
    Internet. In this world, a firewall is essential.</para>

    <para>Don't assume however, that having a firewall makes careful
    configuration redundant, or that it makes any negligent
    misconfiguration harmless. It doesn't prevent anyone from exploiting
    a service you intentionally offer but haven't recently updated or
    patched after an exploit went public.  Despite having a firewall, you
    need to keep applications and daemons on your system properly
    configured and up to date.  A firewall is not a cure all, but should
    be an essential part of your overall security strategy.</para>

      <para>This is a system placed between the Internet and an intranet.
      To minimize the risk of compromising the firewall itself, it should
      generally have only one role&mdash;that of protecting the intranet.
      Although not completely risk free, the tasks of doing the routing and
      IP masquerading (rewriting IP headers of the packets it routes from
      clients with private IP addresses onto the Internet so that they seem
      to come from the firewall itself) are commonly considered relatively
      secure.</para>

      non-firewall services such as a web-cache or mail.  This may be used

      only machine because the combination of server and router/firewall on
      one machine raises the complexity of the setup.</para>
