      <application>MIT Kerberos V5</application> is a free implementation
      of Kerberos 5. Kerberos is a network authentication protocol. It
      centralizes the authentication database and uses kerberized
      applications to work with servers or services that support Kerberos
      allowing single logins and encrypted communication over internal
      networks or the Internet.
