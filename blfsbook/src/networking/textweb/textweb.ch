  <para>People who are new to Unix-based systems tend to ask the question "Why on
  earth would I want a text-mode browser?  I'm going to compile
  <application>X</application> and use

  know that when (not if) you manage to mess up your graphical browser install
  and you need to look up some information on the web, a console based browser
  will save you.  Also, there are quite a few people who prefer to use one of
  these browsers as their principle method of browsing; either to avoid the
  clutter and bandwidth which accompanies images or because they may use a
