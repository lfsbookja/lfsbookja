    The objective of this section is not to build a
    <application>GNOME</application> desktop, because it depends on
    <application>Systemd</application>, which BLFS doesn't support. Rather, it
    provides packages required for some platform independent
    <application>GNOME</application> applications to build and run properly
    under any Window Manager (e.g.
    <application>Fluxbox</application>,
    <application>Icewm</application>,
    <application>Openbox</application>,
    <application>Sawfish</application>), or Desktop Environment (e.g.
    <application>KDE</application>,
    <application>XFCE</application>,
    <application>LXDE</application>).
